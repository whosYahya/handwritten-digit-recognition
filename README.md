# 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNNs & Tkinter

This project is a simple yet powerful **handwritten digit recognition system** that combines deep learning (CNNs) with a **Tkinter GUI app**. You can draw digits on a canvas, and the system predicts the digit in real-time.

It was an exciting project where I built the machine learning model, trained it on the MNIST dataset, and created a fully interactive desktop application to test it live.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎨 Draw digits directly on a canvas using your mouse or stylus.
- 🔍 Real-time digit prediction with confidence score.
- 🧠 CNN model trained with 98%+ accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
- 💻 Clean and interactive Tkinter GUI.
- ✅ Local application, no internet required.
